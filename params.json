{"body":"# Hello World\r\n\r\nThis is the user page for James Fairbanks. I am trying to migrate all of my writing to lightweight text. I already use org mode in Emacs for my meeting notes. Latex is a bit heavy for most of my text processing which can get away with a lighter markdown. I will see how this whole github pages thing goes.\r\n\r\n# Intensions\r\nThe main purpose of my github repos will be to track and document the scripts that I use for data processing. In my HPC experiments I get a lot of timing data that needs to be visualized for papers and understanding the behavior of codes. The HPClab at GT specifically David Bader's group have been using json formatted output in order to get this timing data. I will be publishing the scripts that I write to parse this. \r\n\r\n## Reproducible Research\r\n\r\nI intend to make all of the data and code available for any papers that I publish. They will each get a separate repository. This will enable others to take my research and verify it. I encourage all scientists to take a similar agenda, and help open science move faster.\r\n\r\n## Data Munging\r\n\r\nI am reading Wes McKinney's book on Python for Data Analysis and so most of my scripts will be using the Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib toolchain for processing and visualizing the data. The book has really showed me some opportunities. I hope to do some serious work with STINGER and its Python API possibly taking a page out of Numpy's book and using Cython to accelerate my Python code for HPC worthiness. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Repo Index\r\n* scripts :: a place for some general scripts\r\n* data_munging :: every project needs some specialized data processing code, hopefully this will aggregate into a library\r\n* STINGER :: a git-svn branch of the STINGER codebase from Georgia Tech \r\n* emacs :: my sweet emacs setup, mostly customizations to Prelude by batsov\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
